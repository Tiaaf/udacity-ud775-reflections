When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     
     Whenever you'd need to share your work or profit of help from community.
     Also, it is safer to keep the repo online as a local one might be affected by the HDD breaking up or an error from the user.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

     If we did pulled automatically to our remote repo, any person working with us on the same repo and pushing its work would automatically push its work into our local repo. It could be catastrophic since it could erase work started on our personal repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is specific to Github. It is taking a repo on github into a copy under our own account. Better use it to work on somenone else project, and maybe later propose a pull request to improve the original work.
    Cloning is taking a repo, local or not, and making a copy of it, which will point at the cloned one. It is used to work locally on a project and have many persons/places where from work on a project.
    Branching is spliting a repo into a non-linear history of commits. It is useful to implement new features or test new features without affecting the main project's history.
